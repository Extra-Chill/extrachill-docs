# Artist Access and Permissions

The Extra Chill Artist Platform allows musicians and music industry professionals to create artist profiles and customizable link pages at extrachill.link. To protect the platform from spam and ensure quality, creating artist profiles requires artist access.

## Who Can Create Artist Profiles

You can create artist profiles if you fall into one of these categories:

**Musicians** - Artists, bands, producers, DJs, and other music creators who want to promote their work and connect with fans.

**Industry Professionals** - Managers, promoters, venue owners, labels, publicists, and others who work in the music industry and need to create profiles for artists they represent.

If you joined through extrachill.link/join, your artist access was granted automatically when you created your account and your first artist profile was set up for you.

## How to Request Artist Access

If you have an existing Extra Chill Community account but cannot create artist profiles, you can request access:

1. Log in to your account at community.extrachill.com
2. Go to your Settings page
3. Click the **Artist Platform** tab
4. Select which best describes you:
   - "I am a musician"
   - "I work in the music industry"
5. Click **Request Access**

You will see a confirmation message that your request has been submitted.

## What Happens After You Request Access

Once you submit your request, the Extra Chill team reviews it manually. This helps maintain the quality and authenticity of the artist directory.

**Approval Timeline** - Most requests are reviewed within a few days. The team receives an email notification when new requests come in.

**Notification** - When your request is approved, you will receive an email with a link to get started. The email will direct you to the Manage Artist Profiles page where you can create your first artist profile.

**If Your Request is Not Approved** - Requests may be declined if the account appears to be spam or does not fit the intended use of the platform. You will not receive a rejection notification.

## What You Can Do With Artist Access

Once you have artist access, you can:

**Create Artist Profiles** - Build profiles for yourself or artists you manage. Each profile includes your artist name, biography, profile image, genre, and location. Profiles appear in the public Artist Directory at artist.extrachill.com.

**Build Link Pages** - Create a customizable link page at extrachill.link/your-artist-name. Add links to your music on streaming platforms, your social media profiles, merchandise store, and anything else you want to share with fans. Customize colors, fonts, backgrounds, and more.

**View Analytics** - See how many people visit your link page and which links get clicked. Use this data to understand what resonates with your audience.

**Manage Band Members** - Invite collaborators to help manage your profile and link page. Band members can edit content and view analytics.

**Collect Subscriber Emails** - Add an email signup to your link page and build a mailing list. Export your subscriber list anytime.

**Create Multiple Profiles** - If you manage multiple artists or have different projects, you can create separate profiles and link pages for each.

## The Difference Between Regular Users and Users With Artist Access

**Regular Extra Chill Users** can:

- Browse the Artist Directory and discover artists
- Follow artists and engage with community features
- Access all other Extra Chill sites (Community Forum, Shop, Events)

**Users With Artist Access** can do everything above, plus:

- Create and manage artist profiles
- Create and customize link pages on extrachill.link
- View link page analytics
- Collect and export subscriber emails
- Invite band members to collaborate

Your Extra Chill account works the same across all sites in the network. Artist access simply unlocks the ability to create and manage artist profiles and link pages.
