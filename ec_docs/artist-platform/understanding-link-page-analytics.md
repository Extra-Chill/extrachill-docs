# Understanding Link Page Analytics

## Overview

Your link page analytics dashboard shows you how people are engaging with your link page. Track page views, see which links get the most clicks, and understand your audience's behavior to improve your page's performance.

Analytics are available directly in your link page editor, where you can view detailed performance metrics, charts, and insights about visitor activity over the past 90 days.

## Accessing Your Analytics

1. Log in to your artist platform account at [artist.extrachill.com](https://artist.extrachill.com)
2. Navigate to the **Analytics** page in your dashboard menu
3. Your analytics dashboard will display with charts and metrics

## Key Metrics

### Page Views

**What it measures**: How many times your link page was visited

**How it works**: Every time someone visits your link page, it's counted as one page view. This includes repeat visitors from the same person.

**What it tells you**: 
- Popular times when your audience visits your page
- Overall reach and traffic trends
- How effective your sharing efforts are

**Example**: If your page shows 150 page views in the last 7 days, that means 150 people (or 150 visits total) viewed your link page during that period.

### Link Clicks

**What it measures**: How many times visitors clicked on the links you've added to your page

**How it works**: Each time someone clicks a link in your link page content area, it's recorded. The system tracks both the number of clicks and the specific link that was clicked.

**What it tells you**:
- Which links are most popular with your audience
- How engaged visitors are with your content
- Which platforms or destinations matter most to your audience

**Example**: If you have 5 links on your page and your analytics show 250 total link clicks, this means visitors found value in your content and followed through to those destinations.

### Top Links

**What it measures**: Which specific links get clicked the most

**How it works**: Your analytics dashboard shows a list of your top performing links, ranked by click count. The system displays both the link text (how you labeled it) and the total number of clicks.

**What it tells you**:
- What content resonates with your audience
- Which platforms drive the most traffic from your link page
- Where to focus when adding or updating links

**Example**: If your "Listen on Spotify" link has 120 clicks but your "Subscribe to Newsletter" link has only 20 clicks, you know your audience prefers streaming over email signup.

## Reading Your Analytics Charts

The analytics dashboard displays line charts showing your page views and link clicks over time.

**How to interpret the charts**:
- The **horizontal axis** shows dates across your selected time period
- The **vertical axis** shows the count of views or clicks
- **Lines that go up** indicate increased traffic during that time period
- **Flat lines** indicate low or no activity during that period
- **Peaks and valleys** show your traffic patterns and busiest days

**Time periods available**: You can view data from 1 to 90 days. The system automatically keeps the last 90 days of data and removes older analytics to maintain performance.

## Using Analytics to Improve Your Page

### Optimize Your Links

1. **Look at your top links** - These are working well. Make sure they're prominent and easy to find on your page.

2. **Review underperforming links** - If a link has very few clicks compared to others, consider moving it higher on the page or removing it entirely.

3. **Update link labels** - If a link's label doesn't match what people expect, your click count will be lower. Make labels clear and descriptive.

### Understand Your Audience's Behavior

1. **Check your peaks and valleys** - If your page gets more traffic on weekends, focus your promotion efforts then. If traffic spikes after you post on social media, that's your most effective promotion channel.

2. **Track changes over time** - When you make changes to your page (add a new link, change colors, reorganize content), watch how your analytics respond to those changes.

3. **Compare metric ratios** - If you have high page views but low link clicks, visitors are interested but not finding what they want. This might mean you need better link labels or organization.

### Increase Engagement

1. **Reorder your links** - Put your best-performing links higher on the page, and move underperforming ones lower or consider removing them.

2. **Improve link text** - Make sure your link labels are clear and tell visitors where they'll go. Vague labels get fewer clicks.

3. **Add links your audience wants** - If you see a traffic spike but those visitors aren't clicking your links, consider what type of link they might be looking for.

4. **Keep your page updated** - Regularly review analytics and update your page. Fresh content and active pages get better engagement.

## Integration with Third-Party Tools

Your link page supports integration with external analytics tools to deepen your insights:

### Google Tag Manager (GTM)

You can add your Google Tag Manager tracking code to your link page for more detailed analytics in Google Analytics. This lets you track user behavior across your link page and beyond.

### Meta Pixel (Facebook)

Facebook Pixel integration allows you to track conversions and build custom audiences based on link page visitor activity. Useful if you're running Facebook ads or want to remarket to your audience.

These tools are optional and configured in your link page's advanced settings. You don't need them to see basic analytics on the Extra Chill platform.

## Important Details About Your Analytics

### Data Freshness

Analytics are updated in near real-time. When someone visits your link page or clicks a link, it may take a few seconds to appear in your dashboard, but updates typically happen within minutes.

### Data Retention

Your analytics data is kept for 90 days. This means:
- Data older than 90 days is automatically removed to keep the system running smoothly
- Plan ahead if you want to preserve specific metrics or trends
- Screenshot or export important data if you need to keep it longer

### What's Tracked

- **Page views**: Every time your link page loads
- **Link clicks**: Every time someone clicks a link in your content area
- **Link metadata**: The text label and destination URL of each clicked link

### What's NOT Tracked

- Who clicks your links (no personal information is collected)
- Actions visitors take after leaving your link page
- Visitor device type, location, or other demographic data

For detailed demographic or behavioral tracking, use Google Analytics or Meta Pixel integration.

## Troubleshooting

### "No analytics data yet"

If your analytics dashboard is empty:
1. You may have just created your link page - give it time to accumulate data
2. Verify that people are actually visiting your link page (share the link and test it yourself)
3. Check that your link page is public and not restricted

### "Low click counts despite high page views"

This usually means:
- Your link labels are unclear or don't match visitor expectations
- Your links are hard to find on the page (try reordering them higher)
- Your link text and URLs don't align with what visitors came to find
- Test changes one at a time and watch how your analytics respond

### "Some links aren't being tracked"

The tracking system only counts clicks on links in your main link page content area. Links in other areas of the page (header, footer, branding) won't be tracked.
