### 🎯 Complete Your Profile

A full profile with bio, image, and social links helps you make a great first impression. Fans are more likely to follow incomplete profiles.

Put your most important links at the top. Most people don't scroll, so make sure they see where to stream your music first.

### 📱 Test on Mobile

Visit your link page on a phone to make sure it looks good. Many fans will find you on mobile!

### 📊 Check Your Analytics

Regularly check which links get the most clicks. Double-check that important links still work.

### 🤝 Invite Collaborators

If you work with other musicians or have a band, invite them to help manage your profile. You can work together.

### 💌 Build Your Subscriber List

Your subscriber list is valuable—use it to stay connected with fans and announce new work.

### ✨ Keep It Fresh

Update your bio, links, and images regularly. Let fans see your latest work and projects.
