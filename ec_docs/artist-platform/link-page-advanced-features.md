# Advanced Link Page Features

Your link page at extrachill.link includes powerful tools for control, customization, and performance tracking. Access these features by editing your link page and navigating to the Advanced, Customize, or Socials tabs.

## Link Expiration

Set expiration dates on individual links so they automatically disappear at a specific date and time. Perfect for limited-time offers, tour dates, or seasonal promotions.

**To use link expiration:**

1. Go to your link page editor and click the **Advanced** tab
2. Enable **Link Expiration Dates**
3. Go to the **Links** tab
4. Edit any link and set an **Expiration Date**
5. The link will automatically be removed when the date arrives

Expired links are permanently deleted. To restore a link, add it again manually.

## Temporary Redirects

Redirect visitors from your main extrachill.link URL directly to one of your links. Instead of seeing your full link page, fans go straight to your chosen destination.

**To set up a redirect:**

1. Go to the **Advanced** tab
2. Enable **Temporary Redirect**
3. Select which link you want visitors redirected to
4. Save your changes

To remove the redirect, uncheck the option and save. Your full link page will display again.

## YouTube Embeds

By default, YouTube links automatically embed as video players on your link page. Visitors can watch without leaving your page.

**To disable embedded videos:**

1. Go to the **Advanced** tab
2. Enable **Disable Inline YouTube Video Player**
3. Save your changes

YouTube links will now open YouTube.com in a new tab instead of embedding.
