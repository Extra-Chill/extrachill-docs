# Managing Artist Roster

The artist roster feature allows you to invite and manage band members or collaborators for your artist profile. You can send email invitations to potential members, track pending invites, and remove existing members as needed.

## Viewing Your Roster

To view and manage your artist roster:

1. Navigate to the artist platform homepage.
2. Click "Manage Artist" from the menu or your artist's card.
3. Select the "Members" tab in the artist profile manager.

The roster section displays:
- **Linked Members**: Current team members with active accounts, including their avatar, display name, and username.
- **Pending Invitations**: Email addresses that have been invited but haven't yet accepted.

## Inviting New Members

To invite someone to join your artist:

1. In the roster section, click "[+] Add Member".
2. Enter their email address in the form that appears.
3. Click "Send Invitation".

An invitation email will be sent automatically. The system determines whether the recipient:
- Is an existing platform user (they'll receive a link to accept the invitation)
- Is a new user (they'll receive a link to create an account and join)

Pending invitations appear in your roster list with their email and invitation status until accepted.

## Managing Existing Members

For linked members in your roster:

- You can remove any member except yourself by clicking the "Remove" button next to their name.
- Removing a member revokes their access to manage the artist profile and link page.

## Accepting Invitations

If you've received an invitation email:

1. Click the link in the email.
2. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to log in or register.
3. Once authenticated, you'll be automatically added to the artist and redirected to their profile.

If the invitation link is invalid or expired, contact the artist who sent it to request a new invitation.
