# Sharing Music

The Extra Chill Community forum is where artists and music lovers share, discover, and discuss music. Post your new releases, seek feedback on demos, or recommend artists you love.

## Where to Share Music

Share your music in the Music Discussion forum:
https://community.extrachill.com/r/music-discussion

This is the main place to discuss the music industry, share your work, and connect with fellow music fans.

You can also share in Local Scenes when posting about regional artists or your local music community:

### Alternative: Share Music Button on Homepage

For quick access, use the Share Music button on the community homepage. This opens a modal that lets you create a new topic directly in the Music Discussion forum.

## How to Create a Music Post

1. Navigate to the Music Discussion forum or use the Share Music button on the homepage to open the creation modal
2. Scroll to the topic creation form at the bottom of the page (or the modal will display it)
3. Enter a descriptive title for your post
4. Write your content in the rich text editor
5. Include links to where people can listen to your music
6. Add brief context about the music, such as genre, inspiration, or what you're looking for
7. Mention if it's your own work, a cover, or a recommendation
8. Click Submit

You can upload images directly into your post using the image button in the editor. Album artwork and promotional photos help your post stand out.

## Engaging with the Community

When you share music, focus on building connections:

### Introduce Yourself

When you post, include a little bit about your project and yourself. This helps people understand what to expect and encourages them to listen.

### Engage with the Community

After posting your music, stick around and participate in other discussions. The upvote and following system helps you build a network, which can be beneficial for your career.

### Get Your Friends Involved

Tell your friends to join the community and engage with your content. This increases your exposure and helps the community grow.

When members comment on your post, you will receive a notification. You can reply to comments or mention other users by typing @username in your reply to notify them directly.

The community uses an upvote system. Click the upvote button on topics and replies you appreciate. Upvotes contribute to the author's community rank.

## Community Ranks

As you participate, you earn points that determine your community rank. Points come from creating topics, posting replies, and receiving upvotes. Your rank appears on your profile and next to your posts.

## Connecting Further

If you want a dedicated presence beyond forum posts, consider setting up an artist profile at https://artist.extrachill.com. This gives you an artist page with your bio and links, plus a link page at extrachill.link/your-name.

Your artist badge will appear next to your name in forum discussions once your profile is active.
