# Sharing Music in the Community

The Extra Chill Community forum is where artists and music lovers share, discover, and discuss music. Post your new releases, seek feedback on demos, or recommend artists you love.

## Where to Post

**Music Discussion** is the main forum for sharing music:
https://community.extrachill.com/r/music-discussion

You can also share in **Local Scenes** when posting about regional artists or your local music community.

## Creating a Topic

1. Navigate to the Music Discussion forum
2. Scroll to the topic creation form at the bottom of the page
3. Enter a descriptive title (e.g., "New Single on Spotify - Indie Folk")
4. Write your content in the rich text editor
5. Click Submit

You can upload images directly into your post using the image button in the editor. Album artwork and promotional photos help your post stand out.

## What to Include

A good music post contains:

- Links to where people can listen
- Brief context about the music (genre, inspiration, what you are looking for)
- Whether it is your own work, a cover, or a recommendation

Keep descriptions conversational. The community responds best to authentic posts that invite discussion.

## Engaging with Replies

When members comment on your post, you receive a notification. You can also mention other users by typing @username in your reply to notify them directly.

The community uses an upvote system. Click the upvote button on topics and replies you appreciate. Upvotes contribute to the author's community rank.

## Community Ranks

As you participate, you earn points that determine your community rank. Points come from creating topics, posting replies, and receiving upvotes. Your rank appears on your profile and next to your posts.

## Connecting Further

If you want a dedicated presence beyond forum posts, consider setting up an artist profile at https://artist.extrachill.com. This gives you:

- An artist page with your bio and links
- A link page at extrachill.link/your-name

Your artist badge will appear next to your name in forum discussions once your profile is active.
