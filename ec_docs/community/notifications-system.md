# Notifications System

The notifications system keeps you informed about activity related to your forum posts and interactions. You'll receive notifications when others engage with your content in the community.

## Accessing Notifications

### Notification Bell

A bell icon appears in the top right corner of the site header when you're logged in. This bell shows the number of unread notifications you have with a red badge.

Click the bell icon to go directly to your notifications page.

## Notification Types

### Replies

You'll receive a notification whenever someone replies to a forum topic you started. This helps you stay engaged in conversations you've initiated.

### Mentions

You'll receive a notification when someone mentions you in forum content using @ followed by your username. This allows you to participate in discussions where others specifically want your input.

## Viewing Notifications

Visit the notifications page to see all your notifications. The page organizes them into two sections:

### New Notifications

Recent notifications you haven't viewed yet appear first. Each notification shows who performed the action, what type of activity it was, and links to the relevant content.

### Previously Viewed

Older notifications you've already seen are listed below the new ones for reference.

Notifications are marked as read once you view the page, and the unread count on the bell icon will update accordingly.
