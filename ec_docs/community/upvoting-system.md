# Upvoting System

Upvoting lets you show appreciation for forum posts without writing a comment. Each upvote contributes 0.5 points toward the author's community rank.

## What You Can Upvote

You can upvote forum topics and replies. You cannot upvote your own content.

## How to Upvote

1. Find the upvote icon (circle with upward arrow) near the post
2. Click the icon to upvote
3. The icon fills in and the count increases by one

To remove your upvote, click the filled icon again. The count decreases and the 0.5 points are removed from the author's total.

## How Upvotes Affect Points

Upvotes are one of four ways to earn points toward your community rank:

- Forum topics: 2 points each
- Forum replies: 2 points each
- Upvotes received: 0.5 points each
- Published articles on extrachill.com: 10 points each

Example: A member with 50 topics (100 pts), 150 replies (300 pts), and 120 upvotes (60 pts) would have 460 total points.

## Where to See Upvotes

- On each forum post (the number next to the upvote icon)
- On your community profile (total points and rank)
- On the community leaderboard

## Key Details

- No daily limit on how many posts you can upvote
